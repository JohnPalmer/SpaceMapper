<![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for installing the app! Space Mapper is part of an academic study on the spaces people move through as they go about their daily activities. If you volunteer to participate in this study, Space Mapper will record your phone\'s location at regular intervals and send this information to researchers at Princeton University. It will also ask you to complete an initial demographic survey when you start using the application and a debriefing survey when you finish.</p>
<p>All of the information you provide will be encrypted and kept confidential. The only people with access to it will be the Space Mapper researchers, and only anonymized results will be shared beyond the research team. You may withdraw from the study at any time and request that all of your data be deleted from the research server.</p>
<p>If you participate in the study, you will be contributing to science and helping to advance our understanding of human movement and spatial segregation. You will also be able to map and analyze your own movement patterns and learn more about the spaces you frequent.</p>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old to participate.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please visit our website our email us at the addresses listed below</p>
<p>If you would like to continue, please read and electronically sign the consent form on the next page. We really appreciate your interest and participation!</p>

<p><b>How do I participate in the research? </b></p>

Just install the application on your phone, open it, and respond to the consent and registration questions. After that, make sure your phone\'s GPS and/or network location receiver is enabled and go about your normal activities. The application will run in the background and it will send your location information to the research server at regular intervals.

<p><b>Will I receive compensation for my participation?</b></p>
 
No, but you will be able to store and map your own locations and you will be contributing to science.
 
<p><b>Can I withdraw from the study and uninstall the application if I don\'t like it?</b></p>
 
Yes. Your participation is entirely voluntary and you may end it whenever you wish. To stop participating, simply switch the application off from the application\'s Preferences menu or uninstall it using your phone\'s Settings menu. If you would like to delete all of your data from the research server, use the withdraw button from the application\'s Activity-Space Project menu.

<p><b>What information will I be sharing with others and how will my identity be protected?</b></p>

The application transmits the following information to the research server: (1) the date and time of your consent, (2) any answers you provide to the initial registration survey, (3) your phone\'s language settings, (4) any answers you provide to the follow-up survey, and (5) regular location updates consisting of latitude, longitude, altitude, accuracy, location provider (i.e. GPS or network), battery status, and time. This is the only information that is collected, it is encrypted on your phone before being sent to the server, and it is decrypted and analyzed by the research team only after being taken off the server. Your information will be used only for the purpose of studying population level questions about mobility and segregation and it will not be shared with anyone outside the research team except to the extent that it has first been aggregated and/or transformed in such a way as to make it impossible for you to be identified. 

<p><b>Are there any restrictions on who may participate?</p></b> 

Yes -- you must be at least 18 years old to participate. In addition, the application will work only on devices running Android. 

<p><b>Is it dangerous to use my phone while driving?</b></p>
 
Yes -- please don\'t! The use of mobile phones while driving can create an increased risk of injury, death, or other harm and is prohibited in many states. We therefore ask that you please refrain from interacting with your phone while driving.  

<p><b>Why do you collect information about my battery?</b></p>

To help us improve the application. The application is designed to be as minimally intrusive as possible, so if we see that it is placing a heavy load on your battery, we will do our best to fix this in future updates.

<p><b>How can I use my own location information?</b></p>

From the application\'s Preferences menu, set the Store My Data option to \"yes\" and choose how much of your information you would like to store by picking from the Storage Period spinner. You locations will be stored on your phone during the period you select, and you will be able to map them and save them to your SD card from the My Data menu. Note that the information you choose to store on your phone for your own use is not encrypted. 

<p><b>When I map my data, some of the locations look wrong. Why is that?</b></p>

The accuracy of your phone\'s location estimates depends on a number of factors, including access to GPS satellite signals and connection to wireless networks. The application is designed to balance accuracy against battery load, so it will sometimes use location estimates that have a large margin of error.

<p><b>Why is the application not recording my location?</b></p>

This could be because it is not turned on, because neither your GPS nor your network location receivers are enabled, or because your phone is simply unable to detect your location in a given place within the minimum accuracy required by the application.

<p><b>Why is the application not uploading my locations to the server?</b></p>

This could be because your phone does not have an internet connection. Once you are sure the phone is connected to the internet, try cliking \"Upload Now\" from the main menu.

<p><b>Who should I contact if I have additional questions?</b></p>

<p><b>STANDARD ADULT CONSENT FORM</b></p>
<p>PRINCETON UNIVERSITY INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD</p>
<p>TITLE OF RESEARCH: Activity-Space Project</p>
<p>INVESTIGATOR: John Palmer</p>
<p>The following informed consent is required by Princeton University for any person
involved in a research study conducted by investigators at the University. This study has been
approved by the University\'s Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects.</p>
<p>You have:</p>
<p>A. Provided me with a detailed explanation of the procedures to be followed in the
project, including an identification of those which are experimental.</p>
<p><b><i>I understand that I must be at least 18 years of age to participate in this project.
I understand that I will be asked to run an application on my mobile phone and
that this application will transmit information about my physical location and movement and my phone\'s battery status and language settings, as
well my answers to survey questions to researchers at Princeton
University.</p>
<p>I understand that the use of mobile phones while driving can create an
increased risk of injury, death, or other harm and is prohibited in many states. I
understand that I am expected to refrain from interacting with the application
or using my mobile phone in any way for this project while driving, and I agree
not to do so. I also understand that safety is the top priority in all aspects of this
project and I agree to use my phone in a safe manner at all times.</p>
<p>I understand that the purpose of this research is to learn about human
movement and spatial segregation; while I will receive no compensation for my
participation, I will be allowed to view and make use of my own information,
including location estimates and maps of my own movement patterns. I
understand that reasonable steps will be taken to protect all identifying
information I transmit from disclosure to any parties other than the research team
and myself and that my information will be used only for scientific purposes.
Finally, I understand that the research team will remove and delete all of the
information I have transmitted if I make such a request through the "Withdraw" section of the application\'s Help menu.</b></i></p>
<p>B. Answered any questions that I have regarding the study.</p>
<p>I understand that:</p>
<p>A. My participation is voluntary, and I may withdraw my consent and discontinue
participation in the project at any time. My refusal to participate will not result in
any penalty.</p>
<p>B. By indicating my consent on this form, I do not waive any legal rights or release
Princeton University, its agents, or you from liability for negligence.</p>
<p>I hereby give my consent to be the subject of your research.</p>
