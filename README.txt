The accompanying folder contains the source code for Space Mapper as well as the license agreements to which it is subject (see the res/raw folder). The only differences between this code and that used to compile the Space Mapper binary that can be downloaded from Google Play are as follows:

1. The author's Google Maps API keys have been removed from the map_layout.xml file.

2. The author's public key has been removed from the res/raw folder.

3. The author's server address has been removed from the Util.java file.

Space Mapper is part of an academic study on the spaces people move 
through as they go about their daily activities. It was written by John R.B.Palmer based in part on code from the Human Mobility Project, written by Chang Y. Chung, Kathleen Li, and Necati E. Ozgencil and from Funf, written by Nadav Aharony, Wei Pan, and Alex Pentland, and from range-seek-bar, written by Stephan Tittel, Peter Sinnott, and Thomas Barrasso.
